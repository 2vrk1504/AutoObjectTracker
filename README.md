# AutoObjectTracker

A template-based object tracker which uses image and signal processing techniques for tracking the object of interest in real time.
A mobile phone app has been developed to interface with an Arduino to control a gimbal set up which performs the object tracking in autonomously once the object of interest has been highlighted.

## Python prototype

The Python prototype of the object tracker involves incremental updates of the _template space_<sup>1</sup>
